ISSP is an international organization where members develop and coordinate annual surveys, mainly in the fields of political science and sociology. The topics of the surveys vary, but topics are replicated every few years so that it is possible to measure the changes in patterns of behavior and attitudes over time and differences between countries and cultures. In 1989, the Norwegian Social Science Data Services (NSD) became member of the ISSP and NSD has since been responsible for conducting the survey in Norway. In 2011, the goal was to collect data on health and health care."}],"timemethod": "Cross-sectional survey","analysisunit": "Individual","country": "Norway","modeofcollection": "Paper/pencil questionnaire and websurvey","samplingprocedure": "The sample has consisted of 3800 units.
